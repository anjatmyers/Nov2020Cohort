        framers and the purpose of the document. The preamble is an introduction to the highest law of the land; it is
        not the law. It does not define government powers or individual rights.

        Establish Justice is the first of five objectives outlined in the 52-word paragraph that the Framers drafted in
        six weeks during the hot Philadelphia summer of 1787. They found a way to agree on the following basic
        principles:

        "We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic
        Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to
