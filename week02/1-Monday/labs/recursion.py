# 1. Write a function called power which accepts a base and an exponent.
# The function should return the power of the base to the exponent.


# 2. Write a function factorial which accepts a number and returns
# the factorial of that number.  A factorial is the product of an
# interger and all the integers below it; eg. , factorial four( 4!) is
# equal to 24, because 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 equals 24.  factorial zero (0!) is always 1.


# 3. Write a function called recursiveRange which accepts a number and adds up all
# the numbers from 0 to the number passed to the function

# 4. Write a recursive function called reverse which accepts
# a string and returns a new string in reverse


# 5. Write a recursive function called isPalindrome which returns
# true if the string passed to it is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
# Otherwise returns false.


# isPalindrome('awesome') // false
# isPalindrome('foobar') // false
# isPalindrome('tacocat') // true
# isPalindrome('amanaplanacanalpanama') // true
# isPalindrome('amanaplanacanalpandemonium') // false


# 6. Write  function called product ofArray which takes in
# an array of numbers and returns the product of them all


# 7. Write a recursive function called fib which accepts a number and
# returns the nth number in teh Fibonacci Sequence. Recall that the
# Fibonacci Sequence is the Sequence of whole numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... which
# starts with 1 and 1, and where ever number
# thereafter is equal to the sum of the previous two numbers.
