Write a word_histogram program that asks the user for a sentence as its input, and prints a dictionary containing the tally of how many times each word in the alphabet was used in the text. For example:

"to be or not to be"
- function  => string
- define dictionary
- split function gives an list of words
- loop through list
- condition: if word isn't in dictionary
    - add to the dictionary : key: word   value: 1 
- condition: if the word is in the dictionary 
    -  update: find existing key and increment value by 1
