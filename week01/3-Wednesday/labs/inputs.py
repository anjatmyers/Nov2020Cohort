# Please enter your name: Eric
# Hello, Eric!
#user_name = input("What's your name?")
#print(f"Hello, {user_name}!")


# Prompt the user for his name using the input function. Example:
# user_name = input("What's your name?")
# print(f"Hello, {user_name.upper()}!")

# OR 
user_name = input("What's your name?").upper()
print(f"Hello, {user_name}!")

# Same as the first exercise, but this time print the user's
# name in ALL CAPS, and also tell them the number of letters in their name.

# (Hint: You'll want to search for documentation on how to uppercase a string.)
