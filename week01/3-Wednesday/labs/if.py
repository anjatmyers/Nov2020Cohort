# Consider a program that determines whether people are tall
# enough to ride a roller coaster


# Given the following code that prompts the user for a
# day number (Remember that the int function converts a numeric string to a number)


# Prompt the user for a day of the week just like
# the previous problem. But this time, print "Go to work" if it's
# a work day and "Sleep in" if it's a weekend day. Example session:


# Prompt the user for a number in degrees Celsius,
# and convert the value to degrees in Fahrenheit and display it to the user.

# Use the following formula:
# F = (C * 9/5) + 32
